/* TO DO
- make a request to PokeAPI, see what the data looks like ( limit the generation)
- design the table I want to create
- create db and table
- transform data (or leave in generations to remove the duplicates here)
- insert it into the table

ETL: Extract Transform Load
    Takes data from multiple sources into a unified data repository
    Can be used to take data from old systems, clean it up to establish consistency and then load data into a target database
